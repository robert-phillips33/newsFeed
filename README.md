<h1 align="center">CONTEXT</h1>
This app was meant to simulate something of a workplace project, where my primary goal was to get it finished and working in around 8 hours.

<h1 align="center">LEARNING GOALS</h1>
- Building upon React.js / JavaScript fundamentals.
- Reinforcing principles related to clean, modular and well-thought out code.

<h1 align="center">WINS // CHALLENGES</h1>

- WIN : In general, i enjoyed working on this application and feel as though i'm getting faster where React fundamentals & the drafting of component architectures are concerned. I finished in 8 hours, woo!

- CHALLENGE : I was a little stuck on using Router with how I had initially invisioned this application, and after messing with one of my UI components for wayyyy too long.. I realized I really didn't need any sort of routing due to the fact that I was going to be implementing a popover element rather than navigating to an entirely new page. I sort of fought the UI component for longer than I'd like to admit before I realized I was trying to make it fit where it shouldn't. Regardless, I feel confident enough using Router and decided to go without it this time.
